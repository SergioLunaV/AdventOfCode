# DAY 2

The game consists on getting a number of red/green/blue cubes from a bag. That will be a set, and a game has multiple sets. For each set, the cubes are returned to the bag.

## PART 1
This program computes the addition of the valid games.

A game is valid when it uses, at maximum, the specified number of each type of cube (RGB).

The data is read from the specified file.

## PART 2
This program finds, for each game, the fewest number of cubes of each color required and compute its productor. The solution is computing the summation of the productor of all the games.
